#FLASK SERVER
install Flask and Flask-CORS using pip
Install request using pip.
COPY THE FLASK CODE, backend.py
{Set up Flask app and CORS to handle cross-origin requests from the React app.
Define a route to handle POST requests for text summarization.
Use a mock summarization function for demonstration}

#FORNT_END
Install Node.js
install Axios
CREAT A REACT APP: 
1. npx create-react-app summereyes
2. cd summereyes
3. npm start
{Create a simple form with a textarea for input and a button for submitting.
Handle form submission and make an API call to the Flask server.
Display the summary received from the Flask server.}

Inorder to avoid encountaring CORS issues:
The CORS issue arises because Flask server and React application are running on different origins (different ports are treated 
as different origins by the browser). The Flask server must include the proper CORS headers to allow the React application 
to make requests to it.

Flask application has been modified to include CORS support for all domains on all routes (for development purposes only, 
for production you should specify the origins):
"CORS(app, resources={r"/summarize": {"origins": "*"}})"

RUN FLASK,
python backend.py
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.
Replace the src/App.js
Replace the src/App.css
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
